# Ratchet

A small discord bot!

## Installation
```pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py[voice]```
```git clone https://github.com/12944qwerty/Ratchet.git```
Then make a file called `.env` and add your token in this format.
`TOKEN=tf24082fh203F@#23gt2G2g23Gtgr4`
(token is not real... I think)

## Running
Just run it!
